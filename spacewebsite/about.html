			<h1><strong>Our Work</strong></h1>
			<p>The day had begun on a bright note. The sun finally peeked through the rain for the first time in a week, and the birds were sinfging in its warmth. <br>There was no way to anticipate what was about to happen. It was a worst-case scenario and there was no way out of it.<br>Sleeping in his car was never the plan but sometimes things don't work out as planned. This had been his life for the last three months and he was just beginning to get used to it. He didn't actually enjoy it, but he had accepted it and come to terms with it. Or at least he thought he had. All that changed when he put the key into the ignition, turned it and the engine didn't make a sound.</p>
